# Hello there ! I'm Yash

Iâ€™m Yash Kumar Verma, a second-year undergraduate student at VIT University, India. have been involved in the world of open-source since I was 15y/o.

## Early Days : Baby Steps
I started my journey with [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/) and was an active contributor whilst participating in Google CodeIn ([finalist in 2017](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/01/google-code-in-2017-winners.html)) for three years. I worked on numerous projects, found bugs & submitted improvements.

This made me really interested in the world of open source, as it gave me the opportunity to work on something that the community was actively using, and how even my small contributions were affecting a large project. 

I maintained one project at FOSSASIA, called [Labyrinth](https://github.com/fossasia/labyrinth). It was a very active project with 1.4k+ ðŸŒŸ start and about 150 forks.

Ever since then, I have kept myself engaged in the world of open-source. This has allowed me to learn about best practices, the logic behind design choices, the impact of minor decisions on project lifecycle, ensuring reliability, and explore new fields.

## Recent History : First Year of College
Last year (in my freshman year), I came across [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/) in an online lab during college classes. The project interested me and upon researching found that it was an [open-source](https://github.com/circuitverse) tool written in javascript and ruby.

During the semester, I digged through the codebase out of curiosity and implemented one new component in the simulator by self that we needed for our experiments during the labs. Currently its being used by CircuitVerse users all over the world! I love the power that Open Source gives to improve the lives of others. 

Later because of my involvement with the project, I was honored to be selected as the **Google Season of Docs Mentor** for the project ([listed here](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2020)). As of now, I perform the roles of a maintainer in two CircuitVerse Projects, and am a member of the organization.

Towards the end of the first year of college, the world faced the COVID-19 virus, that forced everyone to return to the homes from university.

## Present : Second Year of College
Before the start of second year of college, I came to know about MLH Fellowship. (More about my experience in the MLH Fellowship in a separate blog post ðŸ˜‰). I applied into MLH the fellowship, and to my surprise I was among the ~120 students selected in the very first batch. There, I got the opportunity to work along-with a very talented and diverse team, under the guidance of [Jani EvÃ¤kallio](https://jevakallio.dev/) and [Rick Hanlon II](https://github.com/rickhanlonii) (from Facebook). I worked on Facebook's [React Native Framework](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

During my time as a fellow, I specifically worked on decoupling the RNTester application from the React mono-repo, refactoring the codebase, and redesigning the application. This was a challenging and exciting task, with a steep learning curve and tight schedule.

I learned a lot about writing scalable applications, how to work with large codebases, testing mechanisms, application architectures, working in a team, effort estimation, and also time management as I had regular college running with periodic exams parallel to the 40-hour/week fellowship.

As of now, I lead [ACM-VIT](https://acmvit.in/), one of the most active student chapter affiliated to the prestigious [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/) as Director of Technical Operations / Technical Director.

## There's More
This was a general overview of my career in the field of technology, and a lot of details have not been mentioned here. This site has (would have) a separate section of My Experiences and Projects.

Thanks for your time!

Best,
Yash
