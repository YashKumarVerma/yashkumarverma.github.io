This page contains the list of almost all the projects built by me. All projects have a dedicated page about them, which contains other relevant details about the project.

In order to easily filter projects based on tech stack, please checkout the [Filter](https://github.com/yashkumarverma/) page (under construction). If while opening the link of some project, you get a 404, it means that the codebase is private (mainly due to academic submissions). These are made public as soon as the semester in college ends.
