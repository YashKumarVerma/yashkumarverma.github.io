"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,'I had a humble beginning in the world of open source, when I first participated in Google Code-In (now discontinued :(  ). Google CodeIn was like the younger sister of Google Summer of Code, with less organizations and easy to complete tasks. There were no proposals, no commitments, no selections. Everyone was free to pick up "tasks" that organizations gave, and in the end, one of the contributor was selected as a winner. Google CodeIn was different because, there was a sense of\ncompetition in that. Everyone wanted to complete as many tasks as they could, so that they gain an upper hand for the final tally (which was not revealed btw). One fine day the results were announced, and there were a bunch of super happy kids (I got to join this group once) and a  whole lot of angry, grumpy kids who were  not topping that charts (this is where I was for 3 years). '),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Another open source program was Coding Blocks BOSS, where BOSS stands for Bountyful Open Source Summer. Interesting name for an interesting program. BOSS was sponsored by Coding Blocks, a coaching company based in India, lead by talented people who are now part of prestigious MNCs.The rules were simple. Contribute to any coding blocks project, solve the issue, and claim the bounty for it. When the season ended, the top 5 contributors were given prizes like laptops, watches,  kindles etc.\nIt was an overall pleasant experience, but the main issue was the way points were divided and assigned. A number of times, a significantly tough issue was marked with say, 100 points and a hotfix monkey patch was also marked 100. Also, there was a lot of overlapping work, people rushing to claim issues and send PRs, which resulted in multiple people sending PRs for the same change. Apart from that, the event was a good one."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Google Season of Docs is an interesting initiative to include non programmers into the world of open source. Contrary to GSoC, which is mainly for students and recent graduates, GSoD is open to all professions who has experience of technical writing and blogging. The overall plan is same as GSoC, organizations, open source projects, funded by Google, proposals and then a final selection list. While it is often assumed that project maintainers can handle all aspects of their\nprojects, developers who are mainly concerned about code can find this program a bit off their lane."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Finally GSoC, its different. It isn' a competition where people are competing against each other for an invisible index. It isn't a rat race where there's a score chart and people are rushing to gain as much points as possible. It's a mature, decent, and gradual learning experience. The popularity of GSoC ensures that it receives the best of what's there in the community, alongwith a decent stipend. The selection process is through and demands planning, management and a solid deep\ndive in the project. As easy as it might appear, writing the proposal is one of the most challenging part. GSoC requires an overall involvement in the organization community, coding contributions and ability to work on things independently."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"That's all the differences in the experiences I have had in these amazing open source programs."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
